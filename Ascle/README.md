## More examples
Here, we show examples of running a single-document task and a multi-document task. 

For a complete run-through of all tasks, run the demo script using ```python demo.py```. 

For a comprehensive tutorial, check the [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/Ascle/blob/v2.2/Ascle/Ascle_tutorials.ipynb).

### Single-document Task Example
Single document tasks operate on a single free-text record.

```python
from Ascle import Ascle

# create kit 
kit = Ascle()

main_record = "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an \
inherited motor neuron disease caused by the expansion \
of a polyglutamine tract within the androgen receptor (AR). \
SBMA can be caused by this easily."

# add main_record
kit.update_and_delete_main_record(main_record)

# call single-document tasks on main_record
kit.get_abbreviations()
>> [('SBMA', 'Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy'),
    ('SBMA', 'Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy'),
    ('AR', 'androgen receptor')]
```

### Multi-document Task Example
Multi-document tasks operate on several free-text records.

```python
from Ascle import Ascle

# create kit 
kit = Ascle()

''' A document about neuron.'''
record = "Neurons (also called neurones or nerve cells) are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system, "
         "the cells responsible for receiving sensory input from the external world, for sending motor commands to "
         "our muscles, and for transforming and relaying the electrical signals at every step in between. More than "
         "that, their interactions define who we are as people. Having said that, our roughly 100 billion neurons do"
         " interact closely with other cell types, broadly classified as glia (these may actually outnumber neurons, "
         "although itâ€™s not really known)."

''' A document about neural network. '''
cand1 = "A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of "
        "data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to "
        "systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature."

''' A document about aspirin. '''
cand2 = "Prescription aspirin is used to relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (arthritis caused by swelling "
        "of the lining of the joints), osteoarthritis (arthritis caused by breakdown of the lining of the joints), "
        "systemic lupus erythematosus (condition in which the immune system attacks the joints and organs and causes "
        "pain and swelling) and certain other rheumatologic conditions (conditions in which the immune system "
        "attacks parts of the body)."

''' Another document about aspirin. '''
cand3 = "People can buy aspirin over the counter without a prescription. Everyday uses include relieving headache, "
        "reducing swelling, and reducing a fever. Taken daily, aspirin can lower the risk of cardiovascular events, "
        "such as a heart attack or stroke, in people with a high risk. Doctors may administer aspirin immediately"
        " after a heart attack to prevent further clots and heart tissue death."

# add main_record
kit.update_and_delete_main_record(record)

# add supporting_records
kit.replace_supporting_records([cand1, cand2, cand3])

# performs k-means clustering on the 4 documents
kit.get_clusters(k=2)

## Troubleshooting ðŸ”§

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'click._bashcomplete'`

You may have dependency confusion and have the wrong version of click installed. Try `pip install click==7.1.1`.

### The demo.py file outputs "Killed" with no error message.

Your computer does not have enough CPU/GPU/RAM to run this model so your kernel shut down the process because it was starved for resources.

### `TypeError: 'module' object is not callable`

For some reason the PyRuSH module does not behave the same on all machines. Try replacing the line `rush = RuSH('conf/rush_rules.tsv')` with `rush = RuSH.RuSH('conf/rush_rules.tsv')` in the `utils.py` file.

### `AttributeError: 'IntervalTree' object has no attribute 'search'`

Another dependency confusion error: try `pip install intervaltree==2.1.0`.
