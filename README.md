We introduce Ascle, a pioneering natural language processing (NLP) toolkit designed for medical text generation. Ascle is tailored for biomedical researchers and healthcare professionals with an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution that requires minimal programming expertise.  

This work,  [Ascle: A Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit for Medical Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16588),  has been accepted by JMIR recently! 

### Framework of Ascle 

Ascle consists of three modules:

üåü **Generative Functions**: For the first time, Ascle includes four advanced and challenging generative functions: question-answering, text summarization, text simplification, and machine translation; 

**Basic NLP Functions**: Ascle consists of 12 essential NLP functions such as word tokenization and sentence segmentation; 

**Query and Search Capabilities**: Ascle provides user-friendly query and search functions on clinical databases.

## Setup

### Download Repository

You can download Ascle as a git repository; simply clone to your choice of directories (keep depth small to keep the old versions out and reduce size).

```
git clone https://github.com/Yale-LILY/Ascle.git
```

### Environment

```
cd Ascle
python3 -m venv asclevir/
source asclevir/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

NOTE: there is a chance that your Python version is not compatible with scispacy, so you can install with the following command:
```
pip install scispacy
pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.5.0/en_core_sci_sm-0.5.0.tar.gz
```
Then you are good to go!

### Ascle Demo
We provide various generative functions and basic NLP functions. A quick start is to run the demo.py:

```
cd Ascle
python demo.py
```
Note: this may take some time, as some packages will be downloaded. 

#### Load Ascle
```python
from Ascle import Ascle

# create Ascle 
med = Ascle()
```

#### Text Simplification
```python
# Text Simplification

              wheezing. Based on the clinical examination, a diagnosis
              of acute bronchitis is made, and the patient is prescribed 
              a short course of bronchodilators and advised to rest and
              stay hydrated.

   carries signals away from the cell body and to other neurons or to muscles or glands. Neurons are capable of transmitting signals electrically, chemically, or both. They can also store
   information in the form of electrical or chemical changes in their membranes. This information can be retrieved and used later to influence the neuron'

print(med.ask_medical_question(question))

>> """
   Smoking can significantly impact lung function by causing inflammation 
   and damage to the airways and alveoli. This can lead to conditions such 
   as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, which can
   result in difficulty breathing and reduced lung capacity. Smoking also
   increases the risk of developing lung cancer. It is important to quit smoking 
   to protect your lung health and overall well-being.
